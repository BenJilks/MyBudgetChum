Nathan's Ideas:
    More important ones:
    - Link names of places/categories to a certain colour once this has been set once, so they always default to this colour on the chart
    - Line graph for showing amount spent on a specific category over a certain period of time (e.g Spoons over 2020, this will have 12 monthly points connected with price on y axis)
    - Monthly/whatever budget can then be displayed horizontally on the line graph to see when you went over
    - Ability to set currency symbol in settings
    Less important ones:
    - Easily noticed when you go over budget (maybe button for a category goes a certain colour)
    - Home screen ideas - maybe just have categories and their respective budgets? and maybe another line graph showing total money for this month
    - Notification when you are at 80% of a budget for a category? (can set percentage in settings)
